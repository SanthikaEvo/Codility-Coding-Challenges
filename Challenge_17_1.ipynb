    "This is a potential coding challenge that you may come across during an interview process. The service provider is Codility where they allow employers to gauge the coding ability of prospective team members. Codility also provides additional challenges which are freely accessible. I picked one challenge on;\n",

    "\n",
    "A game for one player is played on a board consisting of N consecutive squares, numbered from 0 to N − 1. There is a number written on each square. A non-empty array A of N integers contains the numbers written on the squares. Moreover, some squares can be marked during the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the game, there is a pebble on square number 0 and this is the only square on the board which is marked. The goal of the game is to move the pebble to square number N − 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "During each turn we throw a six-sided die, with numbers from 1 to 6 on its faces, and consider the number K, which shows on the upper face after the die comes to rest. Then we move the pebble standing on square number I to square number I + K, providing that square number I + K exists. If square number I + K does not exist, we throw the die again until we obtain a valid move. Finally, we mark square number I + K.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the game finishes (when the pebble is standing on square number N − 1), we calculate the result. The result of the game is the sum of the numbers written on all marked squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the following array:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A[0] = 1\n",
    "    A[1] = -2\n",
    "    A[2] = 0\n",
    "    A[3] = 9\n",
    "    A[4] = -1\n",
    "    A[5] = -2\n",
    "\n",
    "one possible game could be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "the pebble is on square number 0, which is marked;\n",
    "we throw 3; the pebble moves from square number 0 to square number 3; we mark square number 3;\n",
    "we throw 5; the pebble does not move, since there is no square number 8 on the board;\n",
    "we throw 2; the pebble moves to square number 5; we mark this square and the game ends.\n",
    "The marked squares are 0, 3 and 5, so the result of the game is 1 + 9 + (−2) = 8. This is the maximal possible result that can be achieved on this board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def solution(A)\n",
    "\n",
    "that, given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the maximal result that can be achieved on the board represented by array A.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the array\n",
    "\n",
    "    A[0] = 1\n",
    "    A[1] = -2\n",
    "    A[2] = 0\n",
    "    A[3] = 9\n",
    "    A[4] = -1\n",
    "    A[5] = -2\n",
    "\n",
    "the function should return 8, as explained above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "N is an integer within the range [2..100,000];\n",
    "each element of array A is an integer within the range [−10,000..10,000]."
