    "You are given two non-empty arrays A and B consisting of N integers. These arrays represent N planks. More precisely, A[K] is the start and B[K] the end of the K−th plank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you are given a non-empty array C consisting of M integers. This array represents M nails. More precisely, C[I] is the position where you can hammer in the I−th nail.\n",

    "The goal is to find the minimum number of nails that must be used until all the planks are nailed. In other words, you should find a value J such that all planks will be nailed after using only the first J nails. More precisely, for every plank (A[K], B[K]) such that 0 ≤ K < N, there should exist a nail C[I] such that I < J and A[K] ≤ C[I] ≤ B[K].\n",
